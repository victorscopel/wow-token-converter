**The current version is working only with the front page of the store, still trying to figure out how to make it work with the rest of the site**  

# Wow Token Converter

This script will automaticly check your currency and region and get token price from WoWtoken.info and write in the store page the gold and tokens needed to buy each product from blizzard  
The script also checks your balance and if you have money in it it decreases the value of the product according to the amount of money you have, so you do not need to buy extra tokens

## Example
