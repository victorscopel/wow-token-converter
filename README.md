This script will automaticly check your currency and region and get token price from WoWtoken.info and write in the store page the gold and tokens needed to buy each product from blizzard

#Working currencies and regions

#To Do List

* Make the script work with all currencies and regions
* Make the script work inside pages(like legion page with basic and deluxe version)

You will need tampermonkey(chrome) to install, didn't try to install with the greasemonkey(firefox)
